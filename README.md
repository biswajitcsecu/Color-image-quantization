# Color-image-quantization
Color image quantization is a process of selecting a set of colors to display an image with some representative colors, this without noticeable perceived difference. This algorithm deals with the problem of the quantization errors evaluation in taking into account a probabilistic measure on color space. Developed a imageJ plugin to minimize the possible degradationscolor profile.
